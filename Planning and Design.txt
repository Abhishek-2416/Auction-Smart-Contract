                                                          Planning and Design
    1. The Smart Contract for a Decentralised Auction like an ebay alternative

    2. The auction has an owner(the person who sells the goods or services) , a start and an end date

    3. The owner can cancel the auction if there is an emergency or can finalize the auction after its end time

    4. People will be able to send ETH by calling a function placeBid(). The senders address and the value sent to the auction will be
       stored into a mapping called bids
    
    5. The users are incentivized to bid the maximum they are willing to pay, but are not bound to pay that full amount, but rather to the
       previous highest bid plus an increment. The contract will automatically bid upto a given amount

    6. The highestBindingBid is the selling price and the highestBidder the person who won the auction

    7. After the auction ends the owner gets the highestBindingBid and everybody else withdraws their own amount
